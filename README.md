# Ganja
A simple but scalable FFA Practice Core featuring one Game Mode & Vasar PvP aspects. An example of this Plugin can be found in-game at **ganja.bet:19132**!

The purpose of this Core is to provide the community with a decent template for making a pot server. There are little to no good examples let alone any at all. It has most of Vasar's PvP aspects, back from before it closed. Everything is hard-coded to promote actual use and change of the Core so there's some variety in the community.

Gameplay on Ganja can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Puq4HpencLY).
